Builds a Quantlib framework for iOS

Creates a set of universal libraries that can be used on iOS devices and in the
iOS simulator. Then creates a framework to make using quantlib in Xcode very
easy.

================================================================================
How to use
================================================================================

Download a copy of the Quantlib source code into a directory
Download the buildql.sh script and put it into the Quantlib source directory
Run ./buildql.sh (configuration options are at the start of the script)
Include the Quantlib iOS framework in your xcode project

================================================================================
Example Xcode project
================================================================================

The example xcode project is something that was written quickly to show how to
use the QuantLib C++ library in an Objective-C++ class with an Objective-C
interface. It is not production quality, just a demonstration of how to use the
PIMPL idiom.

It expects both the boost and QuantLib iOS frameworks to be located in 
~/frameworks. It has been built using xcode 4.5.1
